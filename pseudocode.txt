Pseudo code for the password generator app:

Starting our javascript code with variables we will be using
as well as arrays or strings of characters for each group criterias

When the user presses the generate password button , a series of prompts will show up on users screen 



These prompts are the conditions we need to check in order to generate the password:

The first prompt will ask the user how long they want their password to be
Then another confirm prompt will ask the user if they would like to include uppercase
Then another confirm prompt will ask the user if they would like to include numbers
Then another confirm prompt will ask the user if they would like to include special characters

For each of our confirm prompts , we recieve either a truth or false statement
which is then used in our conditional for generating our password

A for loop will be used to iterate through arrays that contain a list of each of these criterias
Then prints out our concatinated result through the password ID
