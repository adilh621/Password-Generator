Pseudo code for the password generator app:

When the user presses the generate password button , a series of prompts will show up on users screen 



These prompts are the conditions we need to check in order to generate the password:

The first prompt will ask the user how long they want their password to be
Then another prompt will ask the user if they would like to include uppercase
Then another prompt will ask the user if they would like to include numbers
Then another prompt will ask the user if they would like to include special characters


A for loop will be used to iterate through arrays that contain a list of each of these criterias
